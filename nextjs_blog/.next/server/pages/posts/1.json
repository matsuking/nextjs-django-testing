{"pageProps":{"id":1,"title":"Two Forms of Pre-rendering","content":"Next.js has two forms of pre-rendering: **Static Generation** and **Server-side Rendering**. The difference is in **when** it generates the HTML for a page.\r\n\r\n- **Static Generation** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML at **build time**. The pre-rendered HTML is then _reused_ on each request.\r\n- **Server-side Rendering** is the pre-rendering method that generates the HTML on **each request**.\r\n\r\nImportantly, Next.js lets you **choose** which pre-rendering form to use for each page. You can create a \"hybrid\" Next.js app by using Static Generation for most pages and using Server-side Rendering for others.","username":"user1","tags":[{"id":1,"name":"Nextjs"},{"id":4,"name":"SSG"}],"created_at":"2023-02-18 11:11:23"},"__N_SSG":true}
