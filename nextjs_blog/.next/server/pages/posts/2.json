{"pageProps":{"id":2,"title":"When to Use Static Generation v.s. Server-side Rendering","content":"We recommend using **Static Generation** (with and without data) whenever possible because your page can be built once and served by CDN, which makes it much faster than having a server render the page on every request.\r\n\r\nYou can use Static Generation for many types of pages, including:\r\n\r\n- Marketing pages\r\n- Blog posts\r\n- E-commerce product listings\r\n- Help and documentation\r\n\r\nYou should ask yourself: \"Can I pre-render this page **ahead** of a user's request?\" If the answer is yes, then you should choose Static Generation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Static Generation is **not** a good idea if you cannot pre-render a page ahead of a user's request. Maybe your page shows frequently updated data, and the page content changes on every request.\r\n\r\nIn that case, you can use **Server-Side Rendering**. It will be slower, but the pre-rendered page will always be up-to-date. Or you can skip pre-rendering and use client-side JavaScript to populate data.","username":"user1","tags":[{"id":1,"name":"Nextjs"},{"id":2,"name":"Vercel"},{"id":3,"name":"React Hooks"},{"id":4,"name":"SSG"},{"id":5,"name":"DRF"}],"created_at":"2023-02-18 11:12:25"},"__N_SSG":true}
